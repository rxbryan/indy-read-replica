When authoring transactions under the policy of Permissioned Write Access, a\nTransaction Author may only write to the Sovrin Ledger by using an authorized\n\n2\n\n\fTransaction Endorser. In the event that Sovrin Foundation enables Public Write Access\nto the Sovrin Ledger, the Transaction Author will not need a Transaction Endorser to\nendorse a Transaction.\nc. Once an initial Transaction has been written to the Sovrin Ledger by the Transaction\nAuthor (“Initial Transaction”), the Transaction Author is granted permission to make\nadditional Transactions to update the state of a previous Transaction (“Update\nTransactions”). A Transaction Author may make Update Transactions if and only if the\nTransaction Author was the Author of the Initial Transaction. Update Transactions are\nTransactions and are subject to all the terms of this Agreement.\n\n3) Transaction Author Obligations\na. With regard to all Transactions written by or on behalf of the Transaction Author to the\nSovrin Ledger (“​Authored Transactions​”), the Transaction Author represents and\nwarrants that:\n1. it has all necessary rights and permissions to write the Authored Transactions;\n2. the Authored Transactions do not and will not violate any applicable law;\n3. the Authored Transactions will not contain data or information that infringes or\nmisappropriates the intellectual property rights of any third party;\n4. it will comply with any requirements imposed by the Transaction Endorser on the\nTransaction Author and any Authored Transactions endorsed by the Transaction\nEndorser;\n5. it will not author Transactions containing Personal Data as that term is defined in\nthe European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“​GDPR​”), except:\ni.\nIn the event that Sovrin Foundation permits Authored Transactions to\ncontain Personal Data, then the Transaction Author represents and\nwarrants that:\nA. it has received express, written consent, in the form required by all\napplicable laws, for the Personal Data to be permanently stored\non the Sovrin Ledger prior to writing such Personal Data to the\nSovrin Ledger;\nB. the consent includes a provision that permits the Data Subject to\nwithdraw its consent or exercise its right to be forgotten pursuant\nto applicable law; and\nC. if the Data Subject who provided express, written consent for the\nstorage of Personal Data on the Sovrin Ledger withdraws its\nconsent or if the Data Subject exercises a right to be forgotten, the\nwithdrawn consent and right to be forgotten request will be\neffectuated by marking the applicable Transaction(s) with a\nTombstone (if such functionality is enabled on the Sovrin Ledger)\nand that such marking will fully satisfy the withdrawn consent\nand/or right to be forgotten request, as applicable.\n6. the Transaction Author shall maintain such written consents (referenced in\n\n3\n\n\fSection 3(a)(5)) for a period of seven (7) years thereafter.\nb. Transaction Author may request that a Steward mark a Transaction as a Node-Specific\nTombstone (if such functionality is enabled on the Sovrin Ledger) if it is invoking a Data\nSubject’s right to erasure of Personal Data.\n\n4\n\n\f4) Governing Law and Forum\nThis Agreement is governed by the law of the State of Delaware, without reference to\nconflict of laws principles. All disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement\nshall be finally settled by binding arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International\nChamber of Commerce by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the said Rules.\nUnless the Parties otherwise mutually agree, such arbitration shall be conducted in the\nEnglish language by electronic exchange of documents and by videoconference. The\narbitrator shall issue a reasoned decision, including findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nThe arbitrator shall require exchange by the Parties of documents relevant to the issues\nraised by any claim, defense, or counterclaim or on which the producing Party may rely in\nsupport of or in opposition to any claim, defense, or counterclaim, with due regard for\neliminating undue burden and expense and the expedited and lower cost nature of\narbitration. At the request of a Party, the arbitrator may at his or her discretion order the\ndeposition of witnesses. Depositions shall be limited to a maximum of three depositions per\nParty, each of a maximum of four hours duration, unless the arbitrator otherwise determines.\nDemand for arbitration may be initiated by either Party on fifteen (15) days written notice by\nemail to the other Party’s designated representative, together with a written specification of\nthe grounds for the dispute and the relief requested. By agreeing to binding and\nnon-appealable arbitration, each party understands that they each forever give up and waive\nany right which each Party may have to resolve any such claim, difference or dispute by\ncourt or jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may bring a proceeding\nseeking equitable or injunctive relief solely and exclusively in the state and federal courts\nlocated in Wilmington, Delaware, to prevent the infringement of intellectual property rights or\nthe disclosure of confidential information. Each Party hereto consents to the exclusive\njurisdiction of such courts for the adjudication of any such equitable or injunctive relief, as\nwell as for any such matters that are excluded from or fall outside of this arbitration\nprovision.\n\n5) Representations and Warranties; Disclaimer\na.
